## Overview

This project showcases two code examples using Selenium for web scraping. The first code scrapes doctor links from a website, and the second code scrapes data from individual doctor profiles.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Selenium library (install using pip: `pip install selenium`)
- Chrome web browser

## Usage

### Code Example 1: Scraping Doctor Links

1. Set the desired number of pages in the `x` variable.
2. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
3. The code will scrape the doctor links from the specified website pages and save them in a list.

### Code Example 2: Scraping Doctor Data

1. Make sure you have a CSV file named 'RateMDs.csv' with a 'urls' column containing the doctor profile URLs.
2. Run the code using a Python interpreter.
3. The code will scrape data from each doctor profile URL and save the results in a CSV file named 'output.csv'.
